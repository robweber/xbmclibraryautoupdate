## Version 0.6.1

- added 2 more custom library path options

## Version 0.6.0

- added "Cleaning" category to schedule a clean operation of the music/video databases. This operation can happen immediately after a scan or once per day/week/month. Verifying source paths before a clean is also supported

## Version 0.5.9

- added a custom video path option to only scan a specific video path instead of the entire library

## Version 0.5.8

- added a 1 minute delay timer before running a scan if XBMC has just exited playback. This should help in scenerios where ending media viewing results in an immediate scan that the user didn't want.

## Version 0.5.7

- merged 'standard' and 'advanced' usage to follow more of the same codebase. Now the standard timer uses a cron expression as well and will start at the top of every hour

## Version 0.5.6

-updated the manual run interface to include information about when the updater will run again

- creates addon data directory if it doesn't exist

## Version 0.5.0

- major changes to settings, split them by General and Timer category
- Advanced timer functions now add the ability to do cron-like scheduling of the update process, thanks to pkscuot for the timer ideas
- option to skip during media playback or run the update anyway

## Version 0.4.1

- added extra setting for a "startup delay" timer. This will only affect the addon when xbmc starts.
- the last running time is now set to a variable so that manual updates will reset the timer, and system resets will start the service where it left off

## Version 0.4.0

- Had a user suggestion to allow for a manual launch of the process as well as the service. Since the service point will ALWAYS launch on startup the manual option will kick off the library update process.

## Version 0.3.9

- running video and music scans side by side never really worked. Now checks if scan is running and waits until complete before running the next scan.

## Version 0.3.5

- now runs as a service instead of needing the autoexec.py file
- removed sample autoexec.py

- fixed a really stupid indent error
